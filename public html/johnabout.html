    Hi I am John Doe. I am 36 years old, and at this point in my life, I want to dedicate myself to public service.
    I was born and raised in Newton, Urgandale, where I was raised by two loving parents.
    During the early years of my life I participated in the Urgandale youth group and played soccer.
    At Newton High School, I was a member of the science club and was interested in chemistry.
    After high school I attended Ohio State University, where I studied biology and law.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After college I needed time to figure out where i wanted to work to make a career for myself. During this time I worked at the local
    Hyvee as a cashier. I worked overtime many days each week, and I never complained. After one year I was promoted to Assistant Manager
    for my hard work. This taught me that no matter what kind of work you do, you will get out what you put into it. This is the type of
    mentality I use to drive myself each day, no matter what I am working on. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I started my political career when I was twenty five and worked on the school board for Rapture county.
    I played a fundamental role in unionizing the school curriculum across Urgandale.
    After that, I served as a congressman in the second district.
    There I used my influence for more nutritious meals in school cafeterias and pushed through legislation to reduce food waste in grocery stores.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I took a break from politics after the birth of my first child.
    I was dedicated to be there for my child in the early and most important years of their life.
    Now I wish to bring that dedication back to the community and serve the country as a senator.
    I think I can really make a difference in the world by giving it my all in the Senate.
    </p>
    
    <p>Being a devout Puritan has made a huge impact on how I lead my life. I lived on an Amish farm and was not exposed to any technology until the age of five.         This makes me a very big supporter of widespread sustenance farming. This would reduce the energy cost of farming by eliminating the need for farming machines.       Farming in this way will also create more jobs by opening up opportunities to be ranch hands. 
    This idea will take us back to the roots of Urgandale and what our great nation was founded on.</p>
       
    <p>
    A lot of kids these days are too worried about getting the next Iphone, or buying a new Mac. If I am elected, I will make sure that young
    children are able to experience what it is like to have fun without using technology or staring at a screen inside. I will show them what
    fresh air and physical exercise can do for you. I will fight our government to make new parks and new playgrounds for kids to play on. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I believe that if we unite as one, then we can make anything happen. If everybody believes strongly about an issue and they want
    change, then we can make that change happen. If I am elected, and you, the people, stand beside me, we will make change and we will
    satisfy all your needs. 
    </p>
        
    <p>I am also an avid reader and would like to start a campaign aimed at the youth of the country to make reading both accessible and appealing. This includes tours to encourage communities to employ "little free libraries" and a discussion about the importance of literature.
